Your objective is to produce a complete specification
You will ask me for explanations about the specification to be created by asking questions, I will answer so you have the information.
Then, you will ask the questions necessary for your understanding before starting. Don't begin the task until it's clear.
Then, you can start writing.
Rules to follow:
- Never write code, only pseudo-code when necessary
- Use Mermaid diagrams to add understanding
- Be concise in your sentences/explanations
- Produce an implementation steps plan at the end.
  Once the specification is done, save it in a Markdown file
  If you loop or get lost, ask me a question so I can guide you.
