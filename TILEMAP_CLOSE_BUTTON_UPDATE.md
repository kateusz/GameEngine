# TileMap Editor - Close Button & Tab Integration Update

## Summary

Successfully integrated the TileMap Editor as a dockable window tab (like Viewport) with a proper close button.

## Changes Made

### 1. TileMapPanel - Added Close Button Support
**File**: `Editor/Panels/TileMapPanel.cs`

**Changes**:
- Added `IsOpen` property to track window state
- Modified `OnImGuiRender()` to:
  - Only render when `IsOpen` is true
  - Support ImGui window close button via `ref isOpen` parameter
  - Automatically close window when TileMap is null
  - Update `IsOpen` state when user clicks close button
- `SetTileMap()` now automatically sets `IsOpen = true`

**Key Code**:
```csharp
public bool IsOpen { get; set; }

public void OnImGuiRender()
{
    if (!IsOpen) return;
    
    bool isOpen = true;
    if (ImGui.Begin("TileMap Editor", ref isOpen))
    {
        // ... editor content ...
    }
    ImGui.End();
    
    if (!isOpen)
    {
        IsOpen = false;
    }
}
```

### 2. EditorLayer - Integrated TileMapPanel
**File**: `Editor/EditorLayer.cs`

**Changes**:
- Added `TileMapPanel` field
- Added to constructor parameters (dependency injection)
- Renders TileMapPanel in `SubmitUI()` alongside other windows:
  ```csharp
  _animationTimeline.OnImGuiRender();
  _tileMapPanel.OnImGuiRender();
  _recentProjectsWindow.OnImGuiRender();
  ```

### 3. TileMapComponentEditor - Uses Shared Panel
**File**: `Editor/Panels/ComponentEditors/TileMapComponentEditor.cs`

**Changes**:
- Receives `TileMapPanel` via constructor injection
- "Open TileMap Editor" button now calls `_tileMapPanel.SetTileMap(component)`
- Removed local panel instance and render logic
- Simplified - editor just opens the shared panel

### 4. Dependency Injection Setup
**File**: `Editor/Program.cs`

**Changes**:
- Registered `TileMapPanel` as singleton:
  ```csharp
  container.Register<TileMapPanel>(Reuse.Singleton);
  ```

## User Experience

### Before
- Clicking "Open TileMap Editor" created a separate non-dockable window
- No proper close button
- Had to press ESC to close

### After
- Clicking "Open TileMap Editor" opens a dockable window tab
- Window appears alongside Viewport, Console, etc.
- Has standard ImGui close button (X)
- Can be docked/undocked like other editor windows
- Clicking close button or setting IsOpen = false closes the window

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Open TileMap Editor"** in Properties panel
2. TileMapComponentEditor calls `_tileMapPanel.SetTileMap(component)`
3. TileMapPanel sets `IsOpen = true` and stores the TileMap reference
4. EditorLayer renders TileMapPanel in its UI pass
5. TileMap Editor window appears as a dockable tab
6. **User clicks close button (X)**
7. ImGui sets `isOpen = false`
8. TileMapPanel updates `IsOpen = false`
9. Window closes on next frame

## Benefits

✅ **Consistent UX** - Works like other editor windows (Animation Timeline, etc.)  
✅ **Proper Close Button** - Native ImGui close button with X  
✅ **Dockable** - Can be docked next to Viewport or anywhere  
✅ **Shared State** - Single TileMapPanel instance across entire editor  
✅ **Clean Architecture** - Follows existing patterns (AnimationTimelineWindow)  
✅ **No Memory Leaks** - Panel managed by DI container  

## Testing Checklist

- [x] TileMap Editor opens when clicking button
- [x] Close button (X) closes the window
- [x] Window can be docked/undocked
- [x] Window appears as tab alongside Viewport
- [x] Multiple opens don't create multiple instances
- [x] Editor builds without errors
- [x] Dependency injection works correctly

## Files Modified

1. `Editor/Panels/TileMapPanel.cs` - Added IsOpen property and close button support
2. `Editor/EditorLayer.cs` - Integrated TileMapPanel rendering
3. `Editor/Panels/ComponentEditors/TileMapComponentEditor.cs` - Simplified to use shared panel
4. `Editor/Program.cs` - Registered TileMapPanel in DI container

## Build Status

✅ **Compiles Successfully** - No errors, only pre-existing warnings
