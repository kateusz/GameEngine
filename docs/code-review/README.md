# Code Review Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive code reviews of various subsystems in the Game Engine.

## Available Reviews

### [Serialization Systems Review](./serialization-systems-review.md)
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Scope:** Scene, Prefab, and Animation serialization/deserialization  
**Files Analyzed:** 9 source files, ~2,500 lines of code  
**Issues Found:** 15 issues (3 High, 5 Medium, 7 Low severity)

**Key Takeaways:**
- **High Priority:** ~70% code duplication between SceneSerializer and PrefabSerializer needs refactoring
- **High Priority:** Thread-safety issues in AnimationAssetManager cache
- **Medium Priority:** Inefficient string allocations during deserialization
- **Recommendation:** Implement unified base serializer class and component registry pattern

**Estimated Refactoring Effort:** 12-22 hours

### [2D Animation System Review](./2d-animation-system-review.md)
**Date:** Previous review  
**Scope:** 2D animation system implementation

## Review Process

All code reviews follow a structured format covering:

1. **Performance & Optimization** - Frame budget, memory management, algorithm complexity
2. **Architecture & Design** - ECS compliance, system dependencies, modularity
3. **Rendering Pipeline** - State management, resource binding, draw call optimization
4. **Threading & Concurrency** - Race conditions, lock contention, thread safety
5. **Resource Management** - Lifetime management, streaming, reference counting
6. **Physics & Simulation** - Fixed timestep, interpolation, collision detection
7. **Platform Compatibility** - Endianness, pointer size, API abstractions
8. **Code Quality** - Magic numbers, error handling, documentation
9. **Safety & Correctness** - Bounds checking, null checks, resource leaks

Each issue includes:
- **Severity** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
- **Category** (from above sections)
- **Location** (file and line numbers)
- **Issue** (clear description)
- **Impact** (performance, correctness, or maintainability effects)
- **Recommendation** (actionable fix with code examples)
